# yt-chill 🎧

YouTube audio in your terminal. Clean and distraction-free.

## What it does

Search YouTube, pick a video, and it starts streaming audio immediately. No menus, no fuss. Results are cached for an hour so repeat searches are instant.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install
cargo install --path .

# Play some lofi
yt-chill "lofi beats"
```

## Usage

```bash
yt-chill "chill beats"           # Stream audio (default)
yt-chill --video "music video"   # Stream with video
yt-chill -d "song name"          # Download as MP3
yt-chill -d --video "tutorial"   # Download as MP4
yt-chill --history               # Replay from history
yt-chill -e                      # Edit config
```

## Keyboard Controls

While playing:
- **Space** — Pause/resume
- **←/→** — Seek backward/forward
- **↑/↓** — Volume up/down
- **q** — Quit
